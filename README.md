# Predictive Carbon Footprint Analysis and Behavioural Recommender System

Overview
This project explores how machine learning can be applied to predict individual carbon footprints and provide personalized behavioural recommendations. Unlike traditional carbon footprint calculators, this system integrates predictive modelling and what-if scenario simulations to help individuals and policymakers identify the most effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
